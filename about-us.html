          <p class="fs-5 text-muted">
            As indigenous professionals on humanitarian sectors and capacity
            buildings, they felt that there is an argent need to interventions
            and they had the ability to access the grass roots and act as a
            bridge between the suffering and desperate local communities and the
            UN agencies, International organizations, well-wishers and charities
            that are willing to help the Somali people. This was the philosophy
            behind the establishment of TTAF Somalia.

          <h5 class="fw-bold">Core Values:</h5>
          <p class="fs-5 text-muted">Below are the core values that drive TTAF:
            <ol>
                <li> <strong>Credibility:</strong> The value of any inquiry lies in the 
                    usefulness of its findings and the appropriateness of 
                    the methodology used in the inquiry. TTAF seeks to 
                    generate findings that are of immediate use to the 
                    communities in their quest for sustainable integrated 
                    development. Our services are thus the result of 
                    credible processes that are easily verifiable;
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Equality:</strong> The essence of communities lies in their 
                        capacity to weave their diversities into a common 
                        strength against adversities. The Somali Society is 
                        characterized of Gender and social disparities, which 
                        are factors in any developmental efforts. In order to 
                        give all sectors of the Society within our areas of 
                        operation an opportunity ‘TTAF applies at all times the 
                        principle of equality. This is ensured by basing all our 
                        interventions on the scale and levels of the
                        need and not on the identity or
                        characteristics of the needy;
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Respect: </strong>The primary – only claimants of the services 
                            provided by ‘TTAF are people - human beings. Their 
                            being human exerts from us the responsibility to 
                            acknowledge them as such and treat them with 
                            respect. In this regard, all interactions by ‘TTAF are 
                            characterized by mutual respect – respect of ourselves 
                            and our Institution and for our clients;
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> ‘TTAF is committed to uphold the highest 
                                moral TTAF ndards in our operations and in this respect 
                                interacts with others honestly and faithfully;
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Dignity:</strong> ‘TTAF holds every person to be worthy of 
                                    esteem and respect. We consciously uphold and 
                                    promote the dignity of all our clients in all our dealings.
                                    </li>
